5/5 highly addicting

## Summary

Candy crush is a tile-based game in which swap tiles of candy to match them up by color, candy type or specialty in order to win.
Each time you match up these mathing candies they are - as the name states- crushed and you are awarded points. When you first begin playing,
each level comes with an objective of reaching a certain amount of points you must earn in order to progress to the next level.

As you progress through levels you are introduced to different mechanics of thhe game such as specialty candies that have different 
effects on the board and a give you a higher score. Striped, wrapped, wheel, swedish fish and color bomb candies each have their own unique benefits such as 
eliminating (crushing) all candy of a specific color it was swiped on, exploding a single row of candies,  or destroying arrays and random sets of candies. Sometimes these mechanics
are used as an objective in a level, such as; "Use 7 striped candies" with x amount of tries. This creates more of a difficulty without adding much more to a level.

As you progress even further into the game you are dealt obstacles such as jelly and chocolate. In some levels you must destroy all of the jelly
to complete the objective, or the jelly is an obstacle. For example, maybe there is a row of jelly at the top and you must crush a row at the bottom to win the game. 
You would first have to get rid of the jelly to progress. Chocolate is (sometimes) a never ending obstacle. If you do not break all of the chocalate pieces in a level,
the chocolate tiles will regenerate throughout the level. Sometimes the chocolate has a spawn tile, which means it cant entirely be avoided and must be kept tame throughout the level.

These different mechanics make the simplicity of a match tile game an addicting treat.


## Final Thoughts

I love that even though these levels progressed with similar objectives, I was constantly being challenged by different elements
such as the amount of moves, time, or specific candies needed in order to pass the level. It keeps a repetitive game feeling fresh. The
colorful layout and design was also very appealing and fit the aesthetic of the game perfectly without being too over bearing.
