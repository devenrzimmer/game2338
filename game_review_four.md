## Summary
BioShock is the first game in the BioShock series which was published by 2K games in 2007.
It is the year 1960 and you begin your journey in the ocean after your character, Jack, survives a plane crash. You swim to a lighthouse
and proceed to take the bathysphere to an underwater city created by the main antagonist, Andrew Ryan. The underwater city, known as Rapture,
was intented to be a perfect utopia until greed took over as supernatural, genetically altered powers were created through the use of Tonics
which genetically mutated people and allowed them powers.

BioShock allows you to customize your experienced based on the plasmids you choose to use and upgrade, which range to an abundance 
of unique powers such as electro bolt, incinerate or enrage, etc. You may also upgrade weapons along the way and collect tonics to upgrade
your character which can help make the game easier or a more customized experience. You are allowed 18 slots for tonics and they can be switched
out throughout the game at a gene bank. Gene Tonics include combat tonics which affect the player's defense and offense qualities, 
physical tonics which affect the player's physical qualities such as the amount of health recieved from nutrition items and engineering tonics 
which help the player's hacking by making challenges easier by giving perks such as less tiles to work with. 

In BioShock you are also given a hint of rpg elements in which the decisions can decide your fate towards the end of the game. 
This is best said by Andrew Ryan, "We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us."
These choices include the options of saving or harvesting the little sisters, which are genetically altered and take Adam from dead bodies.
These characters can be saved and reverted back to their normal form, though if you choose to save them, you will recieve less adam, therefore 
you will not be able to upgrade your powers as much or as fast.

This game is filled with unique enemies, captivating characters, environments with suprises along the way and an exciting yet addicting way
to upgrade your experience and spend your time in Rapture.



## Final Thoughts

BioShock is one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I have ever played. The visuals are vibrant and the underwater city
is a dreamy nightmare which I couldn't get enough of. I spent plenty of time anazlyzing every environment I was thrown into.
Being able to customize my genes and use favorite plasmids to take on Rapture proved to be tempting
when faced with challenges and choices of choosing greed over saving little sisters, which led me to play the game and try every ending to 
get the full experience. The twisted stories kept me invested and remained memorable, as did many of the lines used by the characters.
Overall this remains one of my absolute favorite games for it's art, story and fun gameplay.
