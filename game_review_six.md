## Summary

Valorant is a free online first person tactical shooter game. In this game you and your four teammates must
win a minimum of thirteen rounds as either the defender or attacker. As the attacker you must plant a bomb
known as a "spike" while the defenders protect their area and defuse the spikes. Either team can also win by eliminating all of
the other team's players first

When you start a game of Valorant you will arrive into a lobby where you must pick your character, also known as your agent. Each character has their
own four unique abilities based on either offense, defense, and/or healing as well as an ultimate ability. 
When in the lobby, a random map will be chosen and shown as the game starts. 
Each team will start as a defender or attacker and will switch sides after 12 rounds.

After each round you and your teammates will get credits based on your gameplay. These credits allow you to purchase different guns 
as well as shields. Each gun has it's own special attributes so the better the attributes, the likeliness of it costing more credits.  
The better your team does, the more credits you get- meaning you're likely to get better guns and armor and win the game.
Overall this game requires quick thinking as well as strategy among your choices and your teammates choices and actions.

## Final Thoughts

I truly enjoy this fast paced gameplay though it was a little complicated to get started. You are a better teammate when you understand
your character's abilities and best virtues, therefore, people were not as excited about me starting on their teams. I enjoy that once
you find the character you enjoy playing most, you can add a bit more strategy to every gameplay as well as work better with
your teammates, which adds more fun. While i'm not entirely sure I fully understand every aspect of the game, it has been some of the most
fun i've had with friends. However, a lot of the matches I have had when playing alone has had incredibly toxic players, which is nothing new in
gaming, but I prefer playing with friends.
