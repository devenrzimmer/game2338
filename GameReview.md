## Summary
  Fallout 4 is an action role-playing game from Bethesda Game Studios. In the game you may create an entirely unique character with features that are entirely to your liking or you may choose one of the many base designs from either the female or male character. Before begining your journey into this soon to be post-apocalyptic open world, you explore and interact with your home when traumatizing nuclear events lead you and your family to take shelter in vault 111.
  Suddenly you are awakened from cyrogenic statis to see your spouse murdered and son kidnapped. Breaking free, you embark on a journey of this vast wasteland to try to find your missing son. However, you realize that 210 years have passed and you have much to learn about.
  Fallout has an incredible setting with amazing features and systems such as S.P.E.C.I.A.L., crafting and V.A.T.S. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. feature allows you to take control of your characters perks and stay true to the game you would like to play whether it be a more charasmatic style, or a sneaky pickpocket style. V.A.T.S allows for assisted targeting and creates a fun way to destroy enemies. The enormous crafting system allows you to build your game how you'd like without getting bored.


## Final Thoughts

This game was engaging, addicting and overall a great play. My biggest concern was the usability as someone who is entirely new to the series and the mechanics. While the tutorial section of the intro was effective for the most part, there was so much left unknown which made the game increasingly hard to figure out as I progressed. Trial and error got me as far as it could before I had to look many features and mechanics up. While taking on new missions I realized I was no where near the level I needed to be to complete them and had to reload saves because I would get stuck in the same 3 second loop without any hope of escaping. The character interaction was fun to take control of and I became invested in many characters I enjoyed.
Overall a fantastic game.
