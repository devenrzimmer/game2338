**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? Yes, the goal in each level was made clear 
in the beginning through UI text. The direction the player should venture in the kitchen level was also made clear through an animated scene.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The dodge mechanic isn't necessary, as the enemy attacks are slow enough that you can easily move out of the way.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is not necessarily balanced, the enemies are easy to avoid entirely and dont take much damage, making the game easy to defeat and the items are in a constant placement. The target audience seems to be a younger audience.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The pace of the game is constant and short but seems right for this game.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics fit the theme and reinforced eachother

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Although I enjoy the aesthetic and theme of the game, the pacing was too slow for me and I was able to run through it quickly in different ways, making the game less fun. 

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ There were certain sections in the game such as the first level where using the dodge mechanic would
> cause the upper section of the screen to glitch. I got it to happen by continuously dodging in multiple spots throughout the game. There were also a few playthoughs where an enemy attached to a key would be missing. This occured twice at random.
