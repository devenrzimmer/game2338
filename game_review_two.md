## Summary

Hay Day is an isometric mobile game that allows you to create and customize your own farm. In Hay day you 
will harvest crops, raise farm animals, trade, explore and produce goods while collecting diamonds, gold and items
to help you better design your farm area. Level up to expand and add unlock more in the shop to get the most out of the
experience.

Throughout the building experience of your farm, you have
the option of connecting with friends through facebook, contacts or your player
identification number within the app. 
This feature allows you to check out other player's farms, buy 
items that may be unavailable to you, or that you may be low in stock for 
and gives others the same option. By utulizing this feature,
you are able to expand your farm and level up at a faster rate.

By expanding your farm and clearing land you can add more buildings, animals and crop areas.
Harvesting crops and collecting produce from your farm animals helps to build up the stock on your 
farm and gain you points. The crops and produce may also be used to craft new products, ie. wheat can
be used to craft bread while milk can be used to craft butter. As you level up through the game you
will unlock more craftable products, though the time it takes to craft these objects will increase tremendously,
which makes in-app purchases intriguing.

Finally, the in-app purchases allow you to buy more gold or diamonds. While gold is useful in the stores while purchasing new
buildings, or while making trades online or with the non-playable characters, diamonds offer the player a faster 
way to level up and expand. When crafting higher level items, the time can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes and buildings 
can take hours or days. Using diamonds can cut out the time and allow for more game play. Diamonds may also be used 
in place of gold when you are unable to afford specific items in the shop.


## Final Thoughts
This game was addicting and a great distraction from my everyday life. The constant upgrades to the item and crafting availability
kept the gamefeeling fresh for many levels to come. Being able to see future features that would be unlocked kept me pushing
to reach a certain level as fast as possible and kept me glued to my phone in order to do it.
As someone adamant on exploring and expanding, I was eager to add friends to level up and trade right away.
On the other hand, as an anxious-to-play player, though leveling up felt rewarding, the time it took to construct new buildings or
objects killed the excitement I had for the moment and made it hard to return to the app unless I was willing to dish out a few diamonds 
or make in-app purchases and I would often forget to check on times.
